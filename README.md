# fedimint-wallets — as-built specification

A description of the wallet in
[`douglaz/fedimint-wallets`](https://github.com/douglaz/fedimint-wallets) **as it exists at
that repository's `main` `7225114`** (which contains PR #40, #45, #49 and #50; first written
against `ee4ba1c` on 2026-09-07 and re-read in full against `7225114` on 2026-09-10). Not a
plan, not a roadmap, and not a record of what was intended: where a plan document, an ADR, a
code comment or the glossary says one thing and the code does another, this set records what
the code does and the code repository files the difference in its
[`docs/open-findings.md`](https://github.com/douglaz/fedimint-wallets/blob/main/docs/open-findings.md).

This repository holds **specifications only**: the requirement documents, the ADRs, the glossary
and the gate that checks them. The code, its tests, its runbooks and its issue tracker live in
the code repository, and an unqualified `docs/…` or `wallet-*/…` path anywhere in this set names
a file there. The findings file stays beside the code because each finding names the issue that
tracks it and closes with the pull request that fixes it; the one forward-looking document here
is `11-open-questions.md`.

It was written by reading the code, not the prose. Every requirement traces to a function the
code repository contains; the extraction notes it was built from cite `file:line` for each claim,
and the documents keep the function names so a reader can go and look.

| [`CONTEXT.md`](CONTEXT.md) | The glossary. Entries define the ADR-accepted target and carry a one-line pointer to the gap where the code lags; `F6` and `F7` list them |
| [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/) | The thirty-one decisions and what was rejected to reach them. Canonical where they conflict with older prose; **not** canonical where they describe unbuilt behaviour. Unbuilt in whole or in part: `ADR-0003` (Android silent backup), `ADR-0011` (Keystore, scoped to Android), `ADR-0013` (recurringd), `ADR-0014`'s gating acknowledgement (only a reason-code label exists), `ADR-0016`/`ADR-0017`'s reputation weighting and trust-anchor set (no Nostr source, `FMI-29`), `ADR-0018`'s stranded-funds UI, `ADR-0026` (`F11`), `ADR-0027` (`F13`), `ADR-0028` beyond the config skeleton (`F27`), `ADR-0029`'s hop and set-aside record (`F3`), the threshold-vetted list `ADR-0029` "What this rests on" decides (`F6`) and the persisted committed route (`F7`; `ADR-0030` itself is built, `F4` closed), `ADR-0031` items 2–3 (`F17`), and `ADR-0004`'s Lightning-Address/LNURL send (deferred by the roadmap; `OVR-11`) |

Read `00`, `01` and `03` first. `03` is the part that distinguishes this wallet from a thin
fedimint client: a money operation is a durable, idempotency-keyed intent that survives a crash
at any of four named points without double-paying, and everything else is built around that.

## How much to trust this

Every requirement wears the same costume — a MUST, a stable identifier — and the confidence
behind them is not uniform.

- **Every requirement describes code that exists** and was read on 2026-09-07, then re-read
  against `7225114` on 2026-09-10 by six slice reviewers and a codex + Claude review panel. The unit suite
  was green at `ab52094` (1,071 tests, `CNF-5`); no run is recorded at `7225114`, and a requirement
  is not a test either way: `10-conformance-checklist.md`
  says which behaviour a gate actually exercises, and `HST-23`–`HST-25` and the unchecked `CNF`
  items describe facts no suite touches.
- **Most money paths have also been exercised live** against a two-federation devimint harness
  by the smokes in `10-conformance-checklist.md`. That document says which, and which not.
- **Nothing after build `b5f46de` (2026-07-26) has run against a real federation.** The one
  long-running deployment is a test rig at that build; `main` is 240 commits past it (`HST-24`). Everything
  the evacuation-cap, supersession, watch-suppression and persistence-fix work changed has only
  devimint evidence (`HST-24`).
- **The extraction notes flagged `[verify]` where a fact was inferred rather than read.** Those
  were either resolved by a second read or dropped; none survive as a requirement. `[gap]` items
  became findings.
- **How this set was reviewed.** The first draft was written in one sitting from six extraction
  passes and was not reviewed. On 2026-09-10 six slice reviewers re-read every document against
  the code it describes and a two-model panel (codex + Claude) reviewed the resulting diff over
  six passes, each finding verified against the source before it was fixed. That is a review of
  the *text against the code*, not a test of the code: treat a claim you are about to rely on as
  a pointer to the function it names, and read the function.

## Requirement conventions

Requirements use RFC 2119 keywords — **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **SHOULD**, **MAY** — in the
descriptive sense: "MUST" means the code does this and a change that stops it doing so is a
regression against this document, not that someone decided it ought to. Each is tagged with a
stable identifier:

| Prefix | Domain |
|---|---|
| `OVR-n` | Overview and scope |
| `DOM-n` | Domain model |
| `FMI-n` | Fedimint SDK integration |
| `OPS-n` | Operation and intent lifecycle |
| `API-n` | HTTP API and CLI contract |
| `STO-n` | Persistence |
| `ALC-n` | Allocator, scoring, probes, discovery, tick and scheduler |
| `SEC-n` | Security |
| `HST-n` | Hosts, frontends and deployment |
| `DEF-n` | Defect prohibitions |
| `CNF-n` | Conformance items |
| `Fn` | Open findings — defined in the code repository's `docs/open-findings.md`, cited from here; not gated; tracked one-to-one with `br-…` issues |

### Identifiers are append-only. Text is not.

An identifier is never reused and never renumbered. Deleting a requirement is permitted — the
gap in the sequence is the tombstone — but a withdrawn id must be listed in the index below so an
old citation still resolves. `tools/check_ids.py` enforces most of this: duplicate ids, dangling
citations, sequence gaps not listed as withdrawn, and references to ADRs that do not exist all
fail the gate. It cannot see a deleted **highest** id in a namespace — the range simply shrinks —
so that one case rests on the convention and on review, not on the gate.

### A decision gets its identifier when it is accepted

When a change to the system is accepted, name the identifier that will carry it — the requirement
it amends, or the next free number in the right namespace. Then "did we apply everything?" is a
`grep`, not a memory exercise.

### One owner per rule

A rule lives in one requirement; everywhere else cites it. `DEF-21` is what a second normative
copy costs: seven documents kept saying an evacuation sizes off the flat cap after the code
stopped doing so, and the one an operator reads under pressure was among them.

### Withdrawn identifiers

Deleted from the documents. Never reused. Listed so an older citation still resolves.

| Identifier | Was | Why it went |
|---|---|---|

*(none yet)*

## Gates

```
bash tools/check-all.sh
```

runs the identifier gate. It exits non-zero on any failure and captures each gate's own exit
code rather than the last command's in a pipe. Run it before and after editing this set.
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs the same script on every push and, on every run, breaks a
scratch copy of a document and asserts the gate rejects it, so its green check is evidence
rather than decoration. A withdrawn identifier that is defined again fails it.

## Relationship to the code repository

This set was extracted from `docs/spec/` in the code repository on 2026-09-12 and moved here so
that a specification change and a code change are two different pull requests against two
different gates. The code repository keeps: `docs/open-findings.md` (the gaps, one per tracked
issue); the runbooks (`docs/real-sats-pilot-runbook.md`, `docs/devimint-runbook.md`), which are
operator procedure and remain authoritative for procedure; the older reference documents
(`docs/fedimint-mechanics.md`, `docs/federation-data-sources-spec.md`,
`docs/operation-history-spec.md`), which cite requirement ids here rather than restating them;
the roadmap and the phase plans; and `docs/archive/`, the record of *why* the code is the way it
is. The ADRs and the glossary moved with the requirements because they are the decisions and the
vocabulary the requirements are written in.

A change to the code that changes what a requirement describes lands as two pull requests: the
code first, then the requirement here naming the code repository's merge commit. The findings
file is where the two are allowed to disagree in between.
