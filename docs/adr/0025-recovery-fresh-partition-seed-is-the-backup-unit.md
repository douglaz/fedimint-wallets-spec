# Recovery: the seed is the backup unit, and recovery never wipes

Two decisions define how a funded wallet is rebuilt. They are recorded together because
the second follows from the first plus one fact about the SDK.

**1. The backup unit is the seed plus the joined federations' invite codes — never the local stores.** (Originally written "federation IDs"; an id is a 32-byte hash with no guardian endpoints, and `recover` takes an invite — `SEC-24`, `API-22`.)
[ADR-0003](./0003-recovery-silent-backup.md) already established *what* is backed up; this
adds what is *not*. The wallet's two local stores (the client store holding ecash and the
seed, and the bookkeeping store holding the ledger, policy, and federation registry) carry
**no cross-store point-in-time guarantee**. They are restored together from a single
snapshot, or not at all. A mismatched pair — one store from one moment, the other from
another — is **out of contract**, and the wallet does not defend against it. When a store
is lost, the supported path is Recovery from the seed and each federation's invite code, not a store copy.

**2. Recovery always targets a fresh client partition; it never wipes or reuses one, and it
refuses any federation that is still registered.**
If the federation still has a durable registry row — open, OR registered-but-unopened —
recovery **refuses**. Otherwise (unregistered: a fresh host, or a lost bookkeeping store) it
allocates a new partition, recovers into it, and registers the federation only after recovery
completes. Any pre-existing partition is left untouched and inert.

The refusal is over *registered*, not merely *open*, for a money-safety reason found in
adversarial review. All three legitimate recovery scenarios have the federation unregistered
at recovery time (fresh host and lost-bookkeeping-store have no registry row; a disk-move
carries both stores and simply reopens — no recovery). The one registered-but-unopened state
(bookkeeping store survived, client store lost) is where the danger lives: the surviving
bookkeeping store still holds non-terminal send/move intents, which reconcile auto-re-drives.
Recovery hands back a fresh, EMPTY operation log — but that log is the cross-restart
send-dedup authority, so a re-driven send misses the dedup and funds a second outgoing
contract for an invoice the gateway already settled, producing an automatic double-pay with
no operator action. Refusing every registered federation removes this by construction:
recovery runs only where no surviving intent can exist. The corrupt-partition-with-surviving-
bookkeeping case becomes an operator incident (stop, back up, deliberately clear the
bookkeeping store, then recover), never auto-recovered.

Recovery also confers **user ownership**: it records the durable user-approval state, so the
recovered federation is eligible for automated allocation. Its write promotes *any* prior candidate
state, including `AutoJoined` (`STO-26`) — which a re-`join` does not (`OPS-42`) — but that is
defensive, not a second release path for the probe gate: by §2 above recovery never runs on a
federation that still has a registry row, and auto-join always writes one. Otherwise the
funds return but the allocator, treating the federation as merely agent-discovered, would
never spend from it.

The forcing fact for (2): `ClientPreview::recover` rejects an already-initialized database.
So reusing a federation's existing partition necessarily means **wiping it before
rebuilding** — and a crash inside that window leaves the federation with neither a registry
row nor a partition, and nothing recording that a recovery owned the prefix. That is
silent, unrecoverable fund loss. Recovering into a fresh partition closes the window *by
construction*: nothing is destroyed, so nothing can be half-destroyed. The alternative —
keeping in-place recovery and making the wipe survivable — requires a durable
recovery marker, prefix reservation, interrupted-recovery resume, and a startup rule for
partitions caught mid-recovery. An earlier attempt built exactly that machinery and did not
converge; this decision deletes the problem instead of the symptom.

## Consequences

- **Orphaned partitions accumulate.** A recovered federation leaves its old partition on
  disk. This is safe, not merely tolerable: the registry drives what is opened, and the
  prefix allocator already refuses to reuse a partition for a different federation, so an
  orphan is inert. Reclaiming them is a **deliberate** GC command, never automatic. The
  cost is disk, and it is bounded by how often recovery is run — which is rarely, by design.
- **Recovering a live federation is refused**, not silently coerced. Consistent with the
  operating rule that there is one seed, one live client store, one daemon.
- **No recovery-lifecycle machinery is needed** — no in-progress marker, no resume, no
  mid-recovery startup rule. These exist only to survive a wipe that no longer happens.
- **A mismatched two-store restore is undefined behavior** and is documented as such in the
  runbook and glossary rather than defended in code. Accepting this is what keeps recovery
  small enough to verify.
- Recovery is a long-running operation and therefore runs as a detached driver task under
  [ADR-0024](./0024-fully-async-intent-model.md); it never blocks the actor. Since the
  federation is unregistered until recovery finishes, a running recovery is invisible to the
  Allocator.
- Recovery must be able to **fail**, not hang. Upstream's client parks a failed module
  recovery forever, making "failed" indistinguishable from "slow"; we carry a patch making it
  complete-or-fail so this decision's error path is reachable at all.
