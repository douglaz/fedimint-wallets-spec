# The cross-federation MOVE is a first-class modeled protocol; inflow-direction is the primary lever

From a codex state review (2026-06-29) of the built pure core + the integration plan
([../integration-phase-plan.md](https://github.com/douglaz/fedimint-wallets/blob/main/docs/archive/integration-phase-plan.md)). The architecture
(ADR-0021) holds; the data model was written before the fedimint SDK reality and is
corrected here.

## Decisions

- **Ecash is not fungible across federations.** A move A→B is a protocol: B creates an
  invoice → A pays it (via a shared gateway) → B claims the incoming contract → possibly
  refund. The `Action` set must MODEL this, not hide it.
- **Split the allocator's outputs into executable money-moves vs advisory policy:**
  - Executable (executor intents): `DirectInflow { to }`, `Move { from, to, amount,
    fee_limit, occurrence }`, `Evacuate { from, to, amount, fee_limit, occurrence }`.
  - Advisory (NOT executor intents): `RefuseInflow` / `Cap`. The old `RefuseAllocation`
    is advisory policy (mutates receive routing), never an executor intent.
- **Inflow-direction is the cheap PRIMARY lever.** Directing the next incoming payment to
  the federation that needs funding is ~free; swapping existing balance costs gateway fees.
  Prove the receive + `DirectInflow` path before/with the swap, so the first allocator
  proves cheap allocation, not just expensive rebalance.
- **Idempotency lives at operation granularity, not per-Action.** The journal stores
  durable operation artifacts (operation IDs, invoice, payment hash, gateway pubkey,
  claim/refund state) and RESUMES the same invoice/payment on replay; it never restarts.
  The occurrence/epoch (T10) must land before the `SqliteJournal` schema hardens.
- **Real identities + structured balance.** `FederationId` = the 32-byte consensus hash.
  (Guardian-independence — ADR-0010 — has since been DROPPED as unfeasible in fedimint; only the
  structural `guardian_count`/`threshold` survive.) `balance: Sats` → `{ spendable, in_flight,
  claimable, reserved_fee }` at msat granularity.
- **Spike before model.** Phase 1 leads with a throwaway devimint spike (drive one A→B move
  by hand, crash at every step) to LEARN the real operation state machine; the journal,
  `Action`/`Intent`, and executor are then modeled from what it taught (ADR-0021 Phase 1a→1c).

## Consequences

- These corrections land in Phase 1b (model-from-reality), after the 1a spike. They were
  formerly tracked as TODOs T12-T16; the live backlog is now in `br`.
- Key management shapes storage from day one: sketch seed/Keystore/Block Store/recovery
  (incl. recovery of PENDING operations, not just ecash — ADR-0003/0011) before client DBs.
- Honesty: after ADR-0006, v1 holds ~2 active federations; "allocates across many
  federations" is the candidate/discovery universe + a v2 promise, not the v1 active set.

## Grounding update (2026-06-29) — corrects the "operation state machine" framing

A five-way read of the real fedimint source + the harbor and Fedi wallets (see
[../fedimint-mechanics.md](https://github.com/douglaz/fedimint-wallets/blob/main/docs/fedimint-mechanics.md)) replaced the earlier "spike to learn
the operation state machine, then model it" plan. The learning was done by reading the SDK,
and it corrects this ADR:

- **We do NOT model or re-implement the per-leg send/receive state machines.** Each
  `fedimint_client::Client` owns them, persists them in its own DB, and **auto-resumes them
  on boot** (`sm/executor.rs:581`). A cross-fed move is two ordinary, independently
  crash-safe client operations.
- **What we own is a thin coordination record** linking the two legs — `MoveRecord
  { move_id, occurrence, from, to, amount, fee_cap, gateway, invoice?, recv_op_id?,
  send_op_id?, phase, outcome }` — stored in our app DB. Its phase is *derivable* from which
  fields are set; it is a resume *index*, not a re-implemented state machine. This is the
  harbor/Fedi pattern (pending row keyed by op id → re-subscribe on boot), extended to link
  two op ids because a move spans two clients.
- **Send dedup is client-local and already correct:** the send op id is deterministic from
  the invoice, so re-calling `send(invoice)` after a crash returns `InvoiceAlreadyPaid`
  rather than double-paying — as long as A's client DB survives. We don't re-implement it.
- **Cross-fed value moves via a bridge, not OOB ecash.** The cheap path is the
  shared-gateway internal swap (`is_direct_swap`/`relay_direct_swap`): pick a gateway G in
  both feds, `B.receive(gateway=G)` then `A.send(invoice, gateway=G)`. OOB ecash is
  intra-federation only.
- **Backup must include the federation invite list AND in-flight move state**, not just the
  seed — the seed alone recovers ecash only for feds whose invite codes you already have,
  and recovers no operation log (the one real double-pay hazard is restore-from-seed
  mid-move). Extends ADR-0003.
- **The live devimint A→B run is now a VALIDATION of this grounded model, not the primary
  learning step.** It still gates Phase 1 (ADR-0021), but the model is no longer a guess.

The over-specified `move_sm` rb-lite task (faithfully mirroring SendState/ReceiveState) was
correctly abandoned: those states belong to the clients, not to us.
