# Web frontend: a localhost sidecar, authenticated as a whole, over the full CLI surface

The third frontend (after `wallet-cli` and the planned Android app — ADR-0023) is a **web UI
served by a sidecar process**: a separate binary in this workspace that talks to `walletd` over
`127.0.0.1` with the bearer token, exactly as `wallet-cli` does, and renders HTML instead of a
terminal. It is the everyday surface for a self-hosting user before the Android app exists.

- **Exposure.** The sidecar binds `127.0.0.1`. Reaching it from a phone is the **operator's**
  job, via a private overlay (Tailscale/WireGuard) or their own reverse proxy. The wallet ships
  no public listener, no certificates, and no renewal story.
- **Authentication covers everything.** The complete unauthenticated allowlist is exactly
  `GET /login`, `POST /login`, and `GET /healthz` — the last a deliberate carve-out for supervisors
  that exposes exactly two booleans (sidecar alive, daemon reachable) and no wallet data. There is otherwise no unauthenticated surface — not even balance. Login is a password
  verified with Argon2id, carried by an `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Strict`, host-only session cookie
  whose `Secure` flag follows the **configured public origin's scheme** (the sidecar terminates no
  TLS, so a request-derived condition could never fire). Passkeys/WebAuthn are the planned upgrade,
  so the session layer is built to accept a second credential type without rework.
- **No step-up before spending.** One login gates the whole UI; sending does not prompt again.
- **Parity with everything the daemon API exposes**, including `join`, `approve`, `recover`,
  `reconcile`, and policy edits — but see the amendment below, which carves `recover` back out.
  This is deliberately *not* full `wallet-cli` parity: the agent
  verbs (`discover`, `probe`, `tick`), `history --fed`, numeric `show`, and policy-override
  `status` have no daemon endpoint and are refused by `wallet-cli` in client mode too, so they stay
  CLI + `--standalone` only.
- **Fail closed.** The sidecar refuses to start without a configured password hash. It is
  provisioned by an explicit init subcommand (`0600`, mode re-asserted on write, as
  `walletd` already does for its own secrets). There is no default credential and no
  first-load setup page.
- **State.** The Argon2id hash lives in the sidecar's own `0600` config file; sessions live **in
  memory** as opaque random tokens (no signing key at rest — the cookie is not a JWT). The sidecar never opens `client.db` or `journal.db` — the
  daemon holds those locks exclusively by design.
- **Sessions** use a sliding ~4h idle timeout with an absolute cap of ~24h. Polling requests are
  passive and do not slide the idle timer, or an open tab would never time out. Login is
  rate-limited and the password compared in constant time, matching the daemon's token check.
- **A dedicated origin is required.** Co-hosting the wallet under a path beside another
  application is unsupported: same-origin neighbours can read the CSRF token out of the page and
  drive the wallet, and no cookie attribute prevents it.
- **Long-running operations.** `/v1/history` gains a `?status=open` filter — a read-only journal
  query, the only daemon change this frontend requires. The UI holds **no** in-flight state: it
  reconstructs outstanding operations from the journal on every load and polls
  `/v1/operations/{key}` for what is on screen. There are no notifications in v1.

## Why

- **Localhost + operator-supplied overlay is the honest self-hosted answer.** It gives
  phone-in-hand use without the wallet owning TLS, certificates, or a public listener — the same
  candour as ADR-0002's refusal to pretend about Tor. Note the corollary: because a reverse proxy
  makes every request arrive from `127.0.0.1`, the bind address is **not** an authentication
  boundary. The app-level auth is load-bearing, not defence in depth.
- **ADR-0011 does not port to a browser.** Its instant-view rests on a hardware-backed,
  non-extractable Android Keystore key and a threat model of *physical possession of an unlocked
  device*. A browser has neither. There, "instant view" would publish balance and full payment
  history to anyone who reaches the listener, which is precisely the exposure the `Private`
  glossary entry exists to avoid. ADR-0011 is hereby scoped to the Android app.
- **Full parity keeps this "the CLI in HTML."** Splitting the surface would mean dropping to a
  terminal for federation management, which defeats the point of the frontend.
- **The daemon is money-critical and in production.** It passed a 24h soak and holds real funds,
  so this design deliberately requires exactly one additive, read-only change to it. Server
  push (SSE) was rejected for v1 on that basis; it remains available later.
- **A browser tab cannot track an hours-long Lightning hold.** Background timers are throttled
  and mobile pages are suspended, so polling only ever covers the on-screen case. The journal is
  the durable truth, so the UI is built to reconstruct rather than remember.
- **Fail-closed provisioning** avoids the failure mode that owns self-hosted wallets: a default
  credential, or a first-load setup page that whoever reaches the listener first can claim.

## Amendment (2026-08-07): `/v1/recover` stays CLI-only

The parity decision above holds for every daemon route **except `/v1/recover`**, which the sidecar
does not surface at all. No route, no page, no confirmation flow.

The Consequences section below already identifies the worst case precisely: with no step-up, a
stolen or unattended session can "spend the float *and* call `recover`", and the session timeout is
"the only mitigation". Those two capabilities are not comparable. Spending the float is bounded by
the pilot ceiling and by the per-federation cap; `recover` is bounded by nothing, is irreversible,
and is the one operation whose blast radius is the entire wallet regardless of how little it holds.

Omitting one route removes that worst case at close to zero cost. It is a single line missing from
the route manifest — no new mechanism, no friction on any everyday verb, and specifically **not** a
step-up gate, which this ADR rejected and this amendment does not reintroduce. The rest of the
parity argument is untouched: if the auth layer is trusted for `pay`, it is trusted for `move`.

Recovery remains available through `wallet-cli`, which is where an operator already is when they
are rebuilding a wallet from a seed — a deliberate, rare, offline-ish act, not a thing anyone
reaches for from a browser tab they left open. The reachability cost is therefore near zero, and it
buys back the one outcome no session timeout can undo.

Revisit alongside passkeys, as the Consequences section suggests for the parity trade generally.

## Consequences

- **A live session is full wallet control.** With no step-up and near-full parity, an unattended
  logged-in browser can spend the float *and* call `approve`. The session timeout
  is the only mitigation, which is why it is idle-based and absolutely capped. This is a
  deliberate trade of blast radius for the absence of friction; revisit it if the wallet ever
  holds more than the pilot ceiling, and treat passkeys as the upgrade that makes revisiting
  cheap. `recover` is excluded from this trade by the amendment above.
- **The password protects seed-recovery-level capability**, so its strength is a real security
  parameter, not a formality. Rate limiting is required, not optional.
- **Sessions do not survive a restart.** Restarting the sidecar is therefore a complete
  "revoke all sessions", and the only one available.
- **Exposure correctness is the operator's responsibility.** A misconfigured proxy exposes the
  login page to whatever the proxy is reachable from. The password is what stands there.
- **Deploying this widens what a host compromise costs** while the seed is still plaintext at
  rest (ADR-0026 accepted, not built). It does not change the seed's exposure, but it adds a
  second process that can spend. Public-internet exposure should wait for ADR-0026.
- **One daemon change** is owed by this work — the `?status=open` filter together with its
  skipped-undecodable-row signal, which is the same endpoint, the same handler, and equally
  read-only, to land as one reviewable diff; everything else is additive in a
  new crate. **Status (2026-09-10):** neither the filter nor the sidecar's routes have landed —
  `walletd` still accepts only `limit` and `before_seq` on `/v1/history`, and `wallet-web` is the
  configuration and login-hash skeleton only (`F27` in the code repository's `docs/open-findings.md`; the
  filter is `br-2aa`). The "in production" wording under "Why" above predates the decision to
  treat the long-running deployment as a test rig (`08-hosts-and-deployment.md`). A consequence of holding that line: the web operation-detail page cannot show a
  `Stranded` move's preimage or leg op-ids, because the wire `OperationView` carries neither and
  the rich move record is `--standalone` only. That costs nothing real: stranding is today an
  EVIDENCE-PRESERVATION path, not a recovery one. The preimage is evidence that the send leg
  settled, but it is not recovery material: it claims the source's OUTGOING contract and cannot
  credit the destination. The runbook's answer is to stop the daemon and keep the data directory,
  which preserves the destination's complete client state across both receive-failure branches.
  Exposing the preimage would need a second read-only daemon change nobody has budgeted, and would
  buy a field that recovers nothing.
- **`Actor` is unchanged.** Web-initiated operations are `Actor::User`, like `wallet-cli`'s —
  this is a frontend the owner drives, not a delegated authority. A third `Actor` variant was
  considered and deferred with NWC, where a revocable third-party delegation would need it.
